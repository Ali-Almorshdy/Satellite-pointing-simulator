# Satellite-pointing-simulator
A MATLAB-based tool for simulating satellite attitude and orbit pointing in Earth orbit. It supports single satellites or constellations, visualizes orbit dynamics, and renders 3D spacecraft models using STL files. The tool also models ground station pointing, showing how link geometry and alignment evolve during an orbital pass
