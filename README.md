# Satellite-pointing-simulator
# Satellite Attitude & Orbit Pointing Tool

This project provides a MATLAB-based tool for simulating satellite attitude and orbit pointing.  
It supports single satellites and constellations, with 3D visualization of spacecraft dynamics using STL models.

## How to Run
To start the simulation, run the main script in MATLAB:

```matlab
OrbitPointing.m
Requirements
MATLAB R2021a or later

STL spacecraft model file:
marsSat1.stl
