# Satellite Orbit Pointing Simulation

This project simulates satellite orbit pointing and attitude control using MATLAB.  
It also supports 3D visualization of the satellite using an STL model.

---

## How to Run

To start the simulation, run the main script in MATLAB:

```matlab
OrbitPointing
```

---

## Input Files

- `marsSat1.stl` – 3D satellite model used for visualization.  
- `Documentation.pdf` – Detailed explanation of the laws and methods used in the simulation.

---

## Notes

- Tested on **MATLAB R2021a** and later.  
- Read `Documentation.pdf` for detailed equations and background.
